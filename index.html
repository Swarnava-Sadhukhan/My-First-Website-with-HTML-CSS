			<p> This is my first website. <br> 
				I am trying all the simple features with minimal designs. <br>
				There are two other pages of contact and about us. <br>
			</p>
			<p> This is just a start and I want to do more with it. <br>
				I want to explore front end and back end development. <br>
				Hopefully I will be able to do something useful with this. <br>
			</p>
			<p> You can visit the other pages whose links are given above. <br>
				You may message me in the contact page. <br>
				As i said,this is just a start. I know it is nothing but i will try to do better. <br>
